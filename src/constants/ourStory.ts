We met in 2021 during our final year at university, both serving in the choir of RCF—Christabel as a singer, and myself as a keyboardist. At the time, we hardly noticed each other beyond ministry duties. Things took a turn after a chance encounter during a prayer meeting, where I offered help when Christabel was unwell. That small act of care opened the door to something deeper. In the months that followed, our paths kept crossing—through choir ministration, fellowship activities, and the planning of our send forth event for final year brethren.

What began as casual interactions slowly became meaningful conversations. We officially began dating on January 27th, 2022, and over time, our friendship grew into a partnership built on shared values, faith, laughter, and vulnerability. We’ve seen each other at our best and at our most stretched, and have remained constant through it all.

In October 2024, he proposed in a private cinema surrounded by close friends, sealing a journey that started in obedience and matured through genuine love. Now, after rounds of counseling, prayers, and deep conversations, we’re set to begin the next chapter. Our wedding is just around the corner, and we couldn’t be more ready or more thankful for what lies ahead.
